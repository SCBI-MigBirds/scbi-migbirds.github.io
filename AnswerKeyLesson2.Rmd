# ---- Lesson 2 For Loops and Functions: Exercises  ----
#======================================================================*
# This lesson can be accessed at the following web address:

# http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/ForLoopsAndFunctions.html

#----------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- Set-up ---- 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------*

# Load the library

require(RCurl)

# Provide the web address of the file:

fileURL <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCBI-MigBirds/MigBirds/master/data/exampleBirdData.csv')

# Read in the data:

birdCounts <- read.csv(text = fileURL)

#----------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- Exercise One ----
#----------------------------------------------------------------------*

# Use a for loop to multiply each value in the "count" field of 
# birdCounts by two.

countTimesTwo <- numeric(length = length(birdCounts$count))

for(i in 1:length(birdCounts$count)){
  countTimesTwo[i] <- birdCounts$count[i]*2
}

#----------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- Exercise Two ----
#----------------------------------------------------------------------*


# 1. Use the combine function to create a seed vector of two values, 
#    zero and one.

fSeries <- c(0,1)

# 2. Use the formula above and your seed vector to generate the first
#    20 numbers of the Fibonacci number sequence. Hint: The for loop
#    initialization will begin at third position - it will NOT include
#    all of 1:20!

for(i in 3:20){
  fSeries[i] <- fSeries[i-1] + fSeries[i-2]
}

#----------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- Exercise Three ----
#----------------------------------------------------------------------*

# Set-up 1. Create a vector of foraging guilds:

foragingGuilds <- unique(birdCounts$foraging)

# Set-up 2. Create an empty vector to store the results:

foragingCounts <- numeric(length = length(foragingGuilds))

# Set-up 3. Write a for loop to calculate the sum of counts for each
# guild:

for(i in 1:length(foragingGuilds)){
  foragingSub <- birdCounts[birdCounts$foraging == foragingGuilds[i],]
  foragingCounts[i] <- sum(foragingSub$count)
}

# Set-up 4. Make a data frame for the summed counts for each guild:

foragingFrame <- data.frame(foragingGuild = foragingGuilds, 
                            count = foragingCounts)

# Use the foragingFrame you created above and a for loop to calculate
# the proportion of the observed individuals within each dietary guild.

propForaging <- numeric(length = length(foragingGuilds)) # Empty vector

for(i in 1:length(foragingGuilds)){
  propForaging[i] <- foragingFrame[i, 2]/sum(foragingFrame[,2])
}

data.frame(foragingGuild = foragingGuilds, propForaging)


#----------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- Exercise Four ----
#----------------------------------------------------------------------*

# The mathematical formula for standard error is provided below (see
# instructions). Convert this to an R function (Note: the function for 
# standard deviation is "sd" and the function for square root is "sqrt"):

se <- sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))

#----------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- Exercise Five ----
#----------------------------------------------------------------------*

# 1. Create a function that calculates the mean count for a given diet 
#    guild across sites. Hint: Mean count is the sum of counts divided 
#    by the total number of sites in the birdCounts data frame. Do not
#    use the built-in "mean"" function. 

meanDietGuildFun <- function(dietGuild){
  # Number of sites
    nSites <- length(unique(birdCounts$site)) 
  # Subset birdCounts data frame to the guild of interest:
    guildSubset <- birdCounts[birdCounts$diet == dietGuild,]
  # Calculate the the number of individuals counted for the guild:
    guildCount <- sum(guildSubset$count)
  # Calculate the average count across sites and return output:
    meanGuild <- guildCount/nSites
    return(meanGuild)
}

# Question: Why can't we use the mean function?

# Answer: Because it does not take zeroes into account, thus inflating
# the average counts per site.

# 2. Create a function that calculates the mean count for a selected 
#    trait (e.g. diet or foraging) and guild across sites.

meanTraitGuildFun <- function(trait, guild){
  # Number of sites
    nSites <- length(unique(birdCounts$site)) 
  # Subset birdCounts data frame to the trait and guild of interest:
    guildSubset <- birdCounts[birdCounts[,trait] == guild,]
  # Calculate the the number of individuals counted for the guild:
    guildCount <- sum(guildSubset$count)
  # Calculate the average count across sites and return output:
    meanGuild <- guildCount/nSites
    return(meanGuild)
}

# ---- Optional challenges! ----
#----------------------------------------------------------------------*

# 1. The species-area relationship of Arrhenius (1921) states that the
#    number of species (S) is dependent on the rate of increase in 
#    species with increasing area (z) multiplied by a constant (c) that
#    represents the number of species that would be present in one
#    spatial unit. This model is summarized as (see instuctions):

#    a. Convert the species-area relationship formula to an R function,
#       with c, A, and z set as unknowns.

sarFun <- function(c, A, z){
  S <- c * A^z
  return(S)
}

#    b. Create a vector named areaVector of areas values ranging from
#       1 to 10.

areaVector <- 1:10

#    c. Using 15 for the value of c and a z of 0.75, use a for loop to
#       calculate the expected species richness for your areaVector. 
#       Note: You don't really need to use a for loop for this, but 
#       it's good practice!

sarV <- numeric(length = length(v))

for(i in 1:length(areaVector)){
  sarV[i] <- sarFun(c = 15, A = areaVector[i], z = 0.75)
}

# 2. The exponential population growth model describes the growth of a
#    population without resource limitations. This model describes the 
#    size of a population (Nt) at a given time unit as a function of 
#    the per capita growth rate of the population (r) and the size of 
#    the population at time t. This model is summarized as (see 
#    instuctions):

#    a. Convert the exponential population growth model to an R 
#       function with r, N0, and t as unknowns.

expPopGroFun <- function(r, N0, t){
  Nt <- N0*exp(r*t)
  return(Nt)
}

#    b. With an initial population size of 25 and a per capita growth 
#       rate (r) of 0.45, use the exponential population growth rate 
#       function and a for loop to calculate the size of the population
#       over 10 generations.

Ngeneration <- numeric(length = 10)

for(i in 1:10){
  Ngeneration[i] <- expPopGroFun(r = 0.45, N0 = 25, t = i)
}

# 3. The logistic population growth model (Verhulst) states that the 
#    growth of the population will be constrained by the population 
#    carrying capacity (K) as a function of resource limitations. This
#    model is summarized as (Note: the remaining variables are as 
#    above -- see instructions).

#    a. Convert the logistic population growth model to an R function
#       with r, N0, t, and K as unknowns.

logisticPopGroFun <- function(r, N0, t, K){
  Nt <- K/(1+((K-N0)/N0)*exp(-r*t))
  return(Nt)
}

#    b. With an initial population size of 25, a per capita growth rate
#       (r) of 0.45, and a carrying capacity of 500 individuals, use 
#       the logistic population growth rate function and a for loop to
#       calculate the size of the population over 10 generations.

Ngeneration <- numeric(length = 10)

for(i in 1:10){
  Ngeneration[i] <- logisticPopGroFun(r = 0.45, N0 = 25, 
                                      t = i, K = 500)
}
```
