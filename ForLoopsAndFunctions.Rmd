# For Loops and Functions

### Before you begin:
For this lesson, we will use an example data frame of bird observations. Open R Studio and run the following script to load the data into R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library

require(RCurl)

# Provide the web address of the file:

fileURL <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCBI-MigBirds/MigBirds/master/data/exampleBirdData.csv')

# Read in the data:

birdCounts <- read.csv(text = fileURL)
```

### For loops

A **_for loop_** is a block of code that allows you to repeat an operation a set number of iterations. As data analysis often includes many repeated tasks, _for loops_ can save considerable time, shorten R scripts, and make your scripts more legible. While there are many functions that replace the necessity of _for loops_, you will inevitably have to use them at some point in your data analyses and thus understanding how they work is crucial. 

_For loops_ require three components:

1. An empty vector, matrix, or list item to store output from the loop
2. **For loop initialization**: The locations for which the loop will run
3. **For instuctions**: what will occur during each iteration of the loop

Let's create some example data using the first five counts in birdCounts:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
V0 <- birdCounts$count[1:5]
V0
```

The value V0[i] is equal to the value at position i in vector V0. Let's take a look at the value of V0 at position 3:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
V0[3]
```

This  could also be written as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
i <- 3

V0[i]
```

We'll start with a very simple loop. We would like to add one to each number in vector V0 and store the results in a new vector, V1. This would be written mathematically as:

$$V_{1, i} =  V_{0, i} + 1$$


First, we create an empty vector, V1, to store the results (Note: We specify the length of the vector to provide R with stopping rules -- without this _for loops_ can become very memory hungry when running over large datasets):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
V1 <- numeric(length = length(V0))
```

If we want to calculate V0 + 1 at position 3 for our new vector V1, we would write:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
V1[3] <- V0[3] + 1
```

Let's compare the initial value of V0 with the resultant value of V1 at position 3:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
V0[3]

V1[3]

i <- 3

V0[i]

V1[i]
```

The utility of the _for loop_ is that we can calculate the above for each position ("i") in vector V0. This is done by setting the "**for loop initialization**" statement which defines the locations over which the _for loop_ will be calculated. The _for loop initialization_ for locations one through five is written as (**DO NOT RUN**):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:5)
```

The above can be translated as "for position i in positions 1 through five".

Because we can determine the length of a vector using the length function (`length(V0)`), we can specify the end point for the  _for loop initialization_ statement as (**DO NOT RUN**):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(V0))
```

The _for loop initialization_ statement is followed by the "**for instructions**" statement that provides instructions for what will happen during each iteration of the loop (with the _for instructions_ surrounded by "{}"). The _for instructions_ associated with our "add one" formula is (**DO NOT RUN**): 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
{V1[i] <- V0[i] + 1}
```

Putting together our _for loop initialization_ and _for instructions_ statements, our completed _for loop_ is written as (**RUN THIS ONE**):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(V0)){
  V1[i] <- V0[i] + 1
}
```

Take a look at the output and compare it with the values of V0:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
V1

V0
```

When writing _for loops_, it is necessary to ensure that the loop is doing what you expect it to do. A simple way to ensure that this is the case is to specify _i_ and run the _for instructions_. For example, to observe the behavior of the _for loop_ at position 3:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

i = 3

V1[i] <- V0[i] + 1

V1[i]

V0[i]

```

Recall that in the introductory lesson, we were able to calculate values for a subset of a data frame, subsetting the data using a logical operator. For example, we could calculate the sum of all individuals within the aerial foraging class across sites as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(birdCounts[birdCounts$foraging == 'aerial','count'])
```

We can use a for loop to calculate this value across foraging guilds. First, we need to create a vector of foraging guilds:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foragingGuilds <- unique(birdCounts$foraging)

foragingGuilds
```

Next, we'll create an empty vector to store our results:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foragingCounts <- numeric(length = length(foragingGuilds))
```

Now, we construct a _for loop_ using our sum operation above. To see how it works, let's first look at our _for instructions_ outside of the loop:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foragingGuilds[4]

sum(birdCounts[birdCounts$foraging == foragingGuilds[4],'count'])
```

Note that the above result is equivalent to our result when we subset the birdCounts dataset using row values.

To evaluate this as a for loop, we run the above _for instructions_ across each of the guilds:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(foragingGuilds)){
  foragingCounts[i] <- sum(birdCounts[birdCounts$foraging == foragingGuilds[i],'count'])
}
```

We can turn our result into a pretty nice looking data frame, using the _data.frame_ function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foragingFrame <- data.frame(foragingGuild = foragingGuilds, count = foragingCounts)

foragingFrame
```

> Use a _for loop_ to calculate the **proportion** of the observed individuals within each dietary guild.

## Functions

In the introductory lesson and above, we have worked with several functions (e.g., "c", "mean"). Functions allow you to simplify complex tasks, which is especially useful if you need to run a task multiple times. Program R contains many functions and many more still are created by R users and provided to the R community as collections of functions known as packages (or libraries). As datasets and data handling needs are often distinct, relying exclusively on built-in and community-defined functions may be limiting. Learning how to create your own functions, or customize existing functions, provides you with the flexibility to solve unique problems, shorten your script, and make your R code more legible for others.

Writing your own functions is easy, as long as you follow the correct syntax. The basic structure is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
theNameOfMyFunction <- function(objectToComputeFunctionFor) {
	What you would like to happen when you run your function
}
```

Let's write a function that will do the same thing as our first for loop -- add 1 to every value in our vector V0.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
addOneFun <- function(x){
	x+1
}
```

Let's run the addOneFun function and compare it to our values in V1 above:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
addOneFun(V0)

V1
```

Let's try writing a more meaningful function. Above, we subset the birdCounts frame by the aerial foraging guild as: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
birdCounts[birdCounts$foraging == 'aerial',]
```

And then calculated the sum of this guild using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(birdCounts[birdCounts$foraging == 'aerial','count'])
```

Let's embed this line of code within a function to extract the sum of counts for a given foraging guild:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foragingSumFun <- function(foragingGuild){
  birdCountSubset <- birdCounts[birdCounts$foraging == foragingGuild,'count']
  return(sum(birdCountSubset))
}
```

We can then calculate the sum of bird counts for any of the guilds with a parsimonious line of code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  foragingSumFun('aerial')

  foragingSumFun('foliage')
  
  foragingSumFun('bark')
  
  foragingSumFun('ground')
```

We can make this function more flexible by allowing us to choose which trait and guild we would like to count:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
traitGuildSumFun <- function(trait, guild){
  birdCountSubset <- birdCounts[birdCounts[,trait] == guild,'count']
  return(sum(birdCountSubset))
}
```

Let's look at a few of the results:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  traitGuildSumFun('foraging','aerial')

  traitGuildSumFun('diet','insectivore')
```

### Functions inside for loops, for loops inside functions

Functions can be placed inside for loops to simplify the writing of scripts.

The sum function that we wrote above simplifies the subsetting and summing of guild counts.

Let's take a look at how we could use this within the _for loop_ we wrote in Section One.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foragingGuilds <- unique(birdCounts$foraging)

foragingCounts <- numeric(length = length(foragingGuilds))

for(i in 1:length(foragingGuilds)){
    foragingCounts[i] <- traitGuildSumFun('foraging',foragingGuilds[i])
}

foragingFrame <- data.frame(foragingGuild = foragingGuilds, count = foragingCounts)

foragingFrame
```

We could simplify our script even further by placing our for loop inside a function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
traitCountFun <- function(trait){
  guilds <- unique(birdCounts[,trait])
  counts <- numeric(length = length(guilds))
  
  for(i in 1:length(guilds)){
    counts[i] <- traitGuildSumFun(trait,guilds[i])
  }
  
  traitFrame <- data.frame(guild = guilds, count = counts)
  return(traitFrame)
}
```

View the results:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
traitCountFun('foraging')

traitCountFun('diet')
```
