**Description**: This script takes students through the steps associated with
developing a Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival model. Students will:
  1. Explore the basics RMark input files    
  2. Learn to run simple and more complex models    
  3. Assess model support and use model averaging to obtain survival and detectability estimates.

## Set-up

RMark is not a stand alone program but, rather, an R interface to **Program Mark**. If you run this program on your own, you will have to install Program Mark on you computer. It is located [**here**](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/downloads/).

Program MARK has a thorough and valuable resource, _Program MARK - A 'gentle introduction'_ (available for download [**here**](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/)), that provides information on the background and application of MARK models. Utilizing this resource really is necessary to understand the often complicated world of modeling survival using mark-recapture data. Additionally, Appendix C of the Gentle Introduction contains more than 100 pages dedicated to RMark (available [**here**](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/pdf/app_3.pdf)) and is the source of much of the material used in this lesson.


```{r eval = F}
install.packages('RMark')
library('RMark')
```

For Mac and Linux users, you must provide R with the path to the executable Mark file. On my computer, this is done as follows (**DO NOT RUN**):

```{r eval = F}
MarkPath='/Users/bsevans/Applications'
```

## Preparing a capture history for Mark analysis

We will use a dataset collected as a part of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center's Neighborhood Nestwatch program. The data are banded and resighted individals at a number of sites throughout Greater Washington D.C.

Load the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library

require(RCurl)

# Provide the web address of the file:

fileURL <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCBI-MigBirds/MigBirds/master/data/encountersNN.csv')

# Read in the data:

encounters <- read.csv(text = fileURL)
```

----

>**Exercise 1**: 
>
> 1. Take a moment to explore the structure and composition of the data frame.  
> 2. How many birds did Neighborhood Nestwatch band?
> 3. In how many banding stations were birds banded ('fm_site')?
> 4. How many species were banded by Neighborhood Nestwatch?

----

We're going to learn a neat trick for subsetting data. There are many sites for which we did not actually resight or recapture birds. The number of years in which a given bird was encountered is represented by the "obs" column. Let's use `dplyr` to determine the maximum number of years a bird was observed for any given site:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
siteYears <- tbl_df(encounters) %>%
  group_by(fm_site) %>%
  summarize(maxYears = max(obs))
```

We want to subset the data to sites with a minimum of three bird observations. To do so, we create a vector of sites in which the maximum number of years is greater than two:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
site3obs <- filter(siteYears, maxYears > 2) %>%
  select(fm_site)
```

Now we can use `%in%` to subset our encounters frame to encounters at sites in which there were at least three observations:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
encountersSub <- tbl_df(encounters) %>% 
  filter(fm_site %in% site3obs$fm_site)
```
---

>**Exercise 2**:    
> 1. How many observations are there in encountersSub?     
> 2. How many sites are there in encountersSub?    
> 3. Use the `dplyr` functions (including piping!) to subset the encountersSub data frame to observations of Northern Cardinal (_Cardinalis cardinalis_), subset to  a data frame of individuals in which sex was identifiable (M or F), adult birds (AHY), then remove the following columns. Assign the name 'eNoca' to the new data frame.
    * band_num    
    * band_age
    * Color.Band
    * d_banded    
    * species

----

Our next goal is to create a capture history column. Let's take look at the data frame:

```{r eval=FALSE}
head(eNoca)
```

We'll use the apply and a custom function to convert our encounter history to 1's and 0's:

```{r eval = F}
dotFun <- function(x) ifelse(x == '.', 0,1)

ch <- apply(eNoca[,1:13], 2,dotFun)
```

And convert the value in each row to a single character string and remove the encounters:

```{r eval = F}
ch<- apply(ch[,1:13], 1, paste, collapse='')  

eNocaCh <- eNoca[,-c(1:13)] 
```

Next, let's rearrange the columns:

```{r eval = F}
noca <- eNocaCh[,c(6:8, 1:5)]
```
----

The field "ch" stands for encounter (capture) history. Notice that each encounter history record contains a string of 0's (no encounter) and 1's (capture or recapture). Preceding 1's are not analyzed (nor is the initial 1, directly).

## Run the simplest of MARK models

We'll now start right away by running a very simple MARK model, but before we do that we need to take a precautionary step. When you run a MARK analysis, it generates a lot of files. Find your current working directory in R (getwd function) and in your file system create a new folder called "mark_scratch". Reset your working directory as follows:

```{r eval = F}
setwd('mark_scratch')
```

Run simple MARK model:

```{r eval = F}
mark1 = mark(noca)
```

On the output you will see:
The MARK model: Phi(~1)p(~1) (intercept-only model)
Parameter count, Negative log-likelihood, and AIC (more on this later)
Beta parameters (slopes), with standard error and confidence intervals
Real parameter estimates.

You can explore model output further using:

```{r eval = F}
summary(mark1)

coef(mark1)

get.real(mark1, 'Phi')

get.real(mark1, 'p')
```

Real estimates can be computed "by hand" by running the `plogis` function on the beta estimate for a given parameter. Try taking the plogis of each of the beta parameter estimates.

To look at the underlying structure of the model, the Parameter Index Matrices (PIMs), you can use the PIMS function. Try simplified as both true and false and observe the output. We'll take a moment to discuss what this means.

```{r eval = F}
PIMS(mark1, 'Phi', simplified = T)

PIMS(mark1, 'p', simplified = T)
```

### A more complex MARK model

We will now explore a dataset that was simulated for RMark.

```{r eval = F}
example.data = convert.inp("dipper",group.df=data.frame(sex=c("M","F"))) 

data(example.data)

head(example.data)

str(example.data)

summary(example.data)
```

Here, we see a much more complex data structure. In addition to capture history and sex, there is a numeric variable (mass) and two additional factor variables (age and region).

To run this model, we will first make it ready for running in MARK. At this point, it is necessary to know that MARK views continuous and categorical (nominal) variables differently.
Categorical variables are known as group variables and must be specified accordingly.
Continuous variables are known as covariates (which are simpler in model construction but provide challenges in assessment).

First we will process the encounter history data frame. 

```{r eval = F}
d.proc = process.data(example.data,
                      groups='sex'),
                      begin.time = 2000)
```

Explore the process data:

```{r eval = F}
class(d.proc)

names(d.proc)
```

Next, we make design data dataframe for our analysis based on the parameter index matrix. This connects the individual sampled with the sampling and data structure.

```{r eval = F}
d.ddl = make.design.data(d.proc, remove.unused = T)
```

As above, take a moment ot explore the output of the design data.

Now, we are ready to construct our models. We must name each model for each parameter, covariate, and group variable of interest. Be careful, however, these models can get cumbersome
very quickly!

One variable for Phi:

```{r eval = F}
Phi.dot = (formula=~1)
Phi.sex = (formula=~sex)
Phi.mass = (formula=~mass)
```

To make an additive model, simple use a "+" sign.Two variables for Phi, additive:

```{r eval = F}
Phi.sex.mass = (formula=~sex+mass)
```

For an interaction term, there are two ways to express it. Two variables for Phi, interaction:

```{r eval = F}
Phi.sex.i.mass = (formula=~sex+mass+sex:mass)
```

Alternatively ...

```{r eval = F}
Phi.sex.i.mass = (formula=~sex*mass)
```

Define models for p (we'll just use year and sex)

```{r eval = F}
p.dot = (formula=~1)
p.sex = (formula=~sex)
```

Now we collect all of the models into a single model list:

```{r eval = F}
cml = create.model.list("CJS")
```

Then run the models all at once:

```{r eval = F}
example.models = mark.wrapper(cml,data=d.proc,ddl=d.ddl, invisible = F)
```

### Model selection

For model selection, it is easy to create an AIC table. We will run the model table function and then discuss the results:

```{r eval = F}
mod.tab = model.table(example.models, use.lnl = T)

mod.tab
```


### Covariate predictions
Likewise, we can predict covariate values, but the process requires
some care.

```{r eval = F}
Phi.mass.predictions=covariate.predictions(example.models, 
            data=data.frame(index=rep(1,20),mass=1:20)) 
```

And create a simple plot of the results:

```{r eval = F}
with(Phi.mass.predictions$estimates, 
{ 
  plot(mass, estimate,type="l",lwd=2,xlab="mass(g)", 
       ylab="Survival",ylim=c(0,1)) 
  lines(mass,lcl,lty=2) 
  lines(mass,ucl,lty=2) 
})
```
