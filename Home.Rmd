# The Ecology and Conservation of Migratory Birds
  
----
  
**Welcome to the Ecology and Conservation of Migratory Birds!** This website will be our home base for the R portion of the course. It will contain all of the R exercises and includes links to help files and data that we will use throughout the course.


## Getting Started

R has become the universal quantitative interface for ecologists - it's free, powerful, flexible enough to do everything but write manuscripts for you, and is relatively user-friendly. If you haven't already, be sure to:

* Download and install the current version of [<img src = "http://rhrv.r-forge.r-project.org/css/images/R.png" height="30px" width = "30px"/>](https://www.r-project.org/)

* Download and install [<img src = "https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blue-250.png" height="75px" width = "75px"/>](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Course activities and lessons
In order to ensure that we are all moving at a similar pace, we will place course lessons on this website immediately prior to classroom activies. All lessons placed on this site will remain following this course and you will therefore have permanent access to everything that we've learned.

### In-class lessons

* [**Lesson 1: Structure, Indexing, and Logic**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/structureIndexingAndLogic.html): In this lesson, which is a subset of our preliminary course, [**Introduction to R**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/IntroductionToR.html), we will review the overall structure of data in R and learn how to use that structure for data manipulation. The emphasis of this lesson is to build an understanding of the R language.

* [**Lesson 2: For loops and Functions**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/ForLoopsAndFunctions.html): In this lesson you will learn how to build for loops and construct your own functions.

* [**Lesson 3: Data manipulation**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/dataManipulation.html): In this lesson you will learn the basics of cleaning and summarizing data using the packages **tidyr** and **dplyr**.    

* [**Lesson 4: Using R as a GIS**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/gisInR.html): In this lesson you will learn how to use R as a geographic information system.

* [**Lesson 5: Grammar of graphics**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/GrammarOfGraphics.html): In this lesson you will learn how to make [**HANDSOME**](http://had.co.nz/me.jpg) graphs using ggplot2.

* [**Lesson 6: Isotope Lab**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/IsotopeLab.html): In this lesson, we will analyze isotope data to estimate the breeding locations of migratory American Redstart (_Setophaga ruticilla_). **Important**: Prior to beginning this exercise, you will need to download and install the JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), located [**here**](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/?source=typ_redirect).    

* [**Lesson 7: Introduction to home range analysis**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/homeRange.html): In this lesson, we will learn how to estimate two- and three-dimensional home ranges.

* [**Lesson 8a Geolocator analysis**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/Geolocator_GeoLight.html): An introductory geolocator analysis.

* [**Lesson 8b Geolocator analysis**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/Geolocator_SGAT.html): An advanced geolocator analysis.


### Preliminary lessons

* [**SWIRL courses**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/swirlCourses.html): Instructions for completing the self-guided SWIRL courses to prepare you for this course. To get the most from this course, we strongly suggest completing these exercises prior to arrival. 
* [**Introduction to R**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/IntroductionToR.html): An introductory lesson in R for completion prior to attending this course. Special attention is given to the format and structure of data in R.
* [**Skill Assessment**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/skillAssessmentMigBirds.html): A worksheet for completion prior to attending the course intended to assess your current skill level with R.

## Useful help file links

* [**Functions List**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/Functions.html): List of functions used for each lesson, sorted by lesson. Includes hyperlinks to R help files.
* [**R for Beginners**](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf): A great introduction to the R programming language.
* [**Introduction to R in Spanish**](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/R-intro-1.1.0-espanol.1.pdf): Great introduction to R programming in Spanish.
* [**R functions**](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/writingFunctions.html): A simple guide we created to help you get started with writing your own functions.
* [**dplyr and tidyr cheat sheet**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf): This handy guide provides a quick reference to data wrangling in dplyr and tidyr.
* [**Tidy Data**](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper): Great paper by Hadley Wickham that outlines his philosphy on creating effectively formatted datasets. Includes many examples of making tidy data from untidy data frames.
* [**R Graphics Cookbook**](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/): This website provides detailed instructions for using ggplot2 and is a condensed version of Leland Chang's R Graphics Cookbook.
* [**Data visualization cheat sheet**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf): This guide is a quick reference guide for ggplot2.
* [**ggplot2 reference site**](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/): List of ggplot2 functions with graphical examples.
