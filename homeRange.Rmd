# Introduction to home range analysis
_Luke L. Powell
Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute  
Migratory Bird Center_

Overview: In this lab you will learn to calculate animal home ranges (both minimum convex polygon and kernel density estimator) using the adihabitatHR package in R. You will also learn to calculate home ranges in 3D

## Set-up 

Install packages and read libraries:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages('adehabitatHR','maptools')

library('adehabitatHR')

library('maptools')
```

Load the data. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RCurl)

fileURL1 <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCBI-MigBirds/MigBirds/master/data/homeRange/RawBrazilTelemData26aug2014.csv')

fileURL2 <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCBI-MigBirds/MigBirds/master/data/homeRange/RSHomeRangeData.csv')

telem<-read.csv(text = fileURL1, 
                header = T, na.strings=c("NA", "NULL", "", "."))

locs<-read.csv(text = fileURL2, 
               header = T, na.strings=c("NA", "NULL", "", "."))
```

Note the "na.strings" argument. This tells R which values should be set as NA. Take a moment to explore each file (e.g., class, head, summary) The data are in UTM format; units are meters. 

##  Some discussion of triangulating and home range theory

raw vs. adjusted azmuth (compass bearing) can calculate declanation and adjust declination [**here**](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/declination). One should either use an uncorrected compass and make corrections later or use one of those compasses with which you can adjust declination on the compass itself

### Conditions that affect radioteletry:
* topography
* wet vegetation
* distance to animal
* size of transmitter
* animal behavior
  

### How to triangulate data
LOCATE III is a free program for PC to do triangulations, but it is buggy. LOAS is a PC-based program to do triangulations - not buggy, but $75.

### home range - how many points until home range stabilizes?
* 2D: usually 30-50 *independent* points is usually enough (Seaman et al. 1999, JWM)
* 3D: around 80 independent points is usually enough (Cooper, Sherry & Marra, 2014, The Auk)
* Discuss Biological (Lair 1987) vs. statistical independence
* can bootstrap to perform an asymptote analysis
* you can check your animals one-by-one (time consuming!) -see excercise below or you could just assume the  of points above


## Prepare the data for adehabitatHR

Pulling off just the X and Y data:

```{r eval=F}
xyt<-subset(locs, select = c(X,Y))
```


Pulling off just the bird IDs:

```{r eval=F}
id<-subset(locs, select = bird)
```

Creating a SpatialPointsDataFrame for the package adihabitatHR

```{r eval=F}
locs1<-id
coordinates(locs1)<-xyt
class(locs1)
```

plotting the point data:

```{r eval=F}
plot(locs1, col=as.data.frame(locs1)[,1]) # specifies unique color for each bird
```

## Minimum Convex Polygons


Running the 95% miminum convex polygon analysis:

```{r eval=F}
cp<-mcp(locs1[,1], percent=95)
```

graphing the polygons and the points:

```{r eval=F}
plot(cp)
plot(locs1, col=as.data.frame(locs1)[,1], add=T)
```

Area - listed in hectares (ha):
```{r eval=F}
cp
```


Write the polygons to a shapefile in the source directory:

```{r eval=F}
writePolyShape(cp,"mcp")
```

## Kernel Density Estimation in 2D

This section teaches you how to calculate home range size using the kernel density estimator.It uses a utilization distribution (ud) to calculate home range size based on the distribution of the points can calculate home range size and running the kernel density estimation (kde) using LSCV (least square cross validataion).
Below, h is the smoothing parameter ... this produces a raster.

```{r eval=F}
  kud<-kernelUD(locs1[,1], h="LSCV")
```

converting the KDE as vectors

```{r eval=F}
homerange <- getverticeshr(kud)
class(homerange)
```

plotting the vector

```{r eval=F}
plot(homerange,col=1:3) 
```

Calculating area for different isopleths (utilization distributions[UDs])
  areas are in hectares
  95 is the standard for "home range size"
  50 is often used for the "core area"
  
```{r eval=F}
kde.areas<- kernel.area(kud, percent=c(50,95))
kde.areas
```

plotting different isopleths
  second animal only
  
```{r eval=F}
  vud<-getvolumeUD(kud)
  image(vud[[2]])
  xyzv <- as.image.SpatialGridDataFrame(vud[[2]])
  contour(xyzv, add=TRUE)
```
KDE home range using href instead of LSCV
 because those isolated homerange blobs look weird!
 
```{r eval=F}
  kud1 <- kernelUD(locs1[,1], h="href")
```

converting the 95 KDE as vectors

```{r eval=F}
  homerange1 <- getverticeshr(kud1, percent = 95)
```

plotting the vector and the points

```{r eval=F}
  plot(homerange1,border=1:3, lwd=6) # this better than before, doesn't it?
  plot(locs1, col=as.data.frame(locs1)[,1], add=T)
```

use your the ecology of the animal to decide which home range method to use

export the shapefiles for the href version of the home ranges

```{r eval=F}
  writePolyShape(homerange1,"95kde")
```

converting the 50 KDE as vectors, the "core area"

```{r eval=F}
  core <- getverticeshr(kud1, percent = 50)
```

plotting the vector and the points

```{r eval=F}
  plot(core,border=1:3, lwd=4, lty = "dashed", add = T) 
```

export the shapefiles for the href version of the home ranges

```{r eval=F}
  writePolyShape(core,"50kde")
```

## 3D Kernel Density Estimation
This code originally written by Nathan Cooper (Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center) and subsequently modified for this course 

### 3D Kernel Data prep


install required packages:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages('ks','MASS', 'KernSmooth', 'CircStats','odesolve','coda','deldir','igraph','RandomFields')
```

Load required packages:

```{r eval=F}
library("ks")
library("MASS")
library("KernSmooth")
library("CircStats")
library("odesolve")  ***not avail for this version of R??! doesn't seem to matter.
library("coda")
library("deldir")
library("igraph")
library("RandomFields")
```
----

**EXERCISE**

1. Remove the column called "rec" from the locs dataset. This way the columns will just be X,Y,Z, and bird.    

2. Check the structure of the dataset to make sure that X, Y, & Z are in number format
str(locs).

3. Split the "locs" object into three different objects: one per animal (call your objects a, b, and c)

4. Remove the bird column from each of the three new objects, a, b & c.

###  3D Kernel Data analyses

Calls the plug-in bandwidth estimator, there are several types of bandwidth estimators - this is generally accepted as the best. If your resulting territories are lots of separated pieces you can multiply Hpi(a) by factors larger than 1.

```{r eval=F}
Ha <- Hpi(a)
Hb <- Hpi(b)
Hc <- Hpi(c)
```

joins 2 datasets and then determines min/mix for each dimension. Important that overlapping territories are evaluated in the same 
physical space. Adds buffer points so that no part of the territories are cut off.

```{r eval=F}
all<-rbind(a,b)

minX<-min(all$X)-25
minY<-min(all$Y)-25
minZ<-0

maxX<-max(all$X)+25
maxY<-max(all$Y)+25
maxZ<-max(all$Z)+5
```

Run the kernel density analysis, gridsize is the number of voxels (3D version of pixel) that the space is divided up to. _Note: This will take a few seconds to run for each bird_.

```{r eval=F}
fhata <- kde(x=a, H=Ha, binned=FALSE, xmin=c(minX,minY,minZ), gridsize = 151, xmax=c(maxX,maxY,maxZ)) 
fhatb <- kde(x=b, H=Hb, binned=FALSE, xmin=c(minX,minY,minZ), gridsize = 151, xmax=c(maxX,maxY,maxZ))
fhatc <- kde(x=c, H=Hc, binned=FALSE, xmin=c(minX,minY,minZ), gridsize = 151, xmax=c(maxX,maxY,maxZ))
```

calculates isopleth at 95% - cta and ctb just produce a number. I think it is the the cutoff for each isopleth. So all voxels with a density greater than cta would be in that isopleth.

```{r eval=F}
cta <- contourLevels(fhata, cont=95, approx=FALSE) 
ctb <- contourLevels(fhatb, cont=95, approx=FALSE)
ctc <- contourLevels(fhatc, cont=95, approx=FALSE)
```

calculates the volume of each territory at 95th isopleth if UTMs used, then units should be m^3

```{r eval=F}
Vol95a<-contourSizes(fhata, cont=95)
Vol95b<-contourSizes(fhatb, cont=95)
Vol95c<-contourSizes(fhatc, cont=95)
```

plotting the home ranges in 3D (Note: You may have to install the program X11 do to this):

```{r eval=F}
plot(fhata,cont=c(95),
  colors=("green"),drawpoints=TRUE,
  xlab="", ylab="", zlab="",
  xlim=c(minX,maxX),ylim=c(minY,maxY),zlim=c(minZ,maxZ),
  size=2, ptcol="green") 
plot(fhatb,cont=c(95),
  colors=("black"),add=TRUE,drawpoints=TRUE,
  xlab="", ylab="", zlab="",
  size=2,ptcol="black")
plot(fhatc,cont=c(95),colors=("red"),add=TRUE,drawpoints=TRUE,
  xlab="", ylab="", zlab="",
  size=2,ptcol="red")
```


###  Bonus code: Asymptote analysis on bird b in 3d

how many points is enough?
  
Start the clock!

```{r eval=F}
ptm <- proc.time()

set.seed(0) # creates the dataset
Vol95.1 = matrix(0, nrow=10, ncol=nrow(b)-4) 

# Note on the above: nrow is number of samples - <100 
# would be ideal but will take forever

# nested for() loop to run the bootstrap
# careful, because this for loop takes a long time - took 123 min on my machine.

# The following step does the calculation from 60 till the length of the dataset. If 
# you could run every few pts instead of every one it would be much faster but have not
# figured out how to do that yet.

for (x in 60:nrow(b)) { 
  for (k in 1:nrow(Vol95.1)) {  
    rows <- sample.int(nrow(b), x) 
    Hb <- Hpi(b[rows,])
    fhatb <- kde(x=b[rows,], H=Hb, gridsize=151, binned=FALSE)
    Vol95.1[k,x-4] <- contourSizes(fhatb, cont=95)
  }
}

# Stop the clock
  
proc.time() - ptm

# Export data
write.csv(asymptote.csv)
```

Exercises

1) plot the bootstrapped home ranges from the asymptote analysis, When does 3D home range stabilize for bird b?    
 
1) change the maximum on the 3D Z axis to 10 and replot this way the graphs will be easier to visualize    

2) For the 2D home ranges, change the colors of the animal home ranges to blue, pink, and orange    

3) Use adehabitat package to determine the amount of overlap (in 2D) between the first and second birds in the locs dataset. I have not done this yet, so seek help online    

4) Does anyone know trigonometry?  If so, write a function to calculate the intersection of two animal signals in the telem dataset hint, solve the problem first, then write the function    

5) Perform a 2D asymptote analysis for bird b, How many points until home range stabilizes in 2D?
