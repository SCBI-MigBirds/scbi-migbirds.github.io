# Pre-assessment: Studying migratory birds in Program R
_Brian S. Evans

In this exercise, you will be asked to complete some typical data handling tasks on an example dataset so that we may gauge your current level of R-mastery.This activity is built for us to determine how to best serve you in the R component of the course. Some of these questions are quite simple while others are meant to be challenging. **Do not feel compelled to answer every question** -- if you reach a question that you cannot answer, you may leave it blank. Prior to completing this exercise, we strongly suggest that you complete the SWIRL exercises (see instructions [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCBI-MigBirds/MigBirds/master/swirlCourses.html)). 

Stumped? It happens to everyone! Some quick search engine queries may help you solve problems (Stack Overflow is often a great source). There’s also a good “R for Beginners” guide (link [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf)) and a great cheat sheet for summarizing data using dplyr (link [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)) available. If you find any of these operations difficult, be sure to revisit the SWIRL exercises!

## Instructions 

 * Open R Studio.
 * Copy-and-paste questions 1-20 into an R script. 
 * Place a “#” before each question – the “#” is used to comment out sections of your script (sections of code not evaluated in R). 
 * To load the data for this exercise, run the following code in R (copy-and-paste):

> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('RCurl')

require(RCurl)

fileURL <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCBI-MigBirds/MigBirds/master/data/exampleBirdData.csv')

birdCounts <- read.csv(text = fileURL)
```

* Below each question prompt, please paste the code (i.e. lines of R script) you used to solve each problem. Do not provide the answers nor a verbal description of the steps taken.

* After completing this exercise, please save it as an R file with the title “yourName_RAssessment.R” and email as an attachment to rydert@si.edu and bsevansunc@gmail.com.
 
## Skill assessment

1. Install the R library (i.e., package) “dplyr” and load the library into R’s global environment.

2. How many records (i.e. rows) does birdCounts contain?

3. How many fields (i.e. columns) does birdCounts contain?

4. What type of object is birdCounts (i.e. data frame, matrix, factor)?

5. What type of object is the birdCounts field labeled “count”?

6. Display the structure (type of objects) of birdCounts and all of its associated fields.

7. Using one line of code, display the number of records and fields in birdCounts.

8. Display the first 10 records of birdCounts.

9. Create a vector of counts from the count field of birdCounts.

10. Display the names of all of the fields in birdCounts.

11. Change the name of the “count” field to “abundance”.

12. Determine how many species were observed in this study.

13. Determine the total observed abundance (i.e., across species) in this study.

14. You want to explore the abundance the Gray Catbird (GRCA, Dumetella carolinensis). Make a reduced data frame containing just this species and call this data frame “grcaCounts”.

15. Display the summary information for grcaCounts (i.e. factor counts and summary statistics such as mean and median abundance).

16. Save grcaCounts as a .csv file to your hard drive.

17. Determine the number of sites in which Carolina Chickadees (CACH, Poecile carolinensis) was observed.

18. Construct a table that summarizes the number of sites in which each dietary guild (field name = “diet”) was observed.

19. Summarize the abundance of birds across sites by making a new data frame called “birdSpeciesCounts”. Your data frame should have only “species” and “abundance” fields.

20. You want to explore patterns of abundance by species. To do so, sort birdSpeciesCounts from highest to lowest abundance.

----

**A challenge**! Write a function that calculates the standard error of Gray Catbird abundance. Standard error can be defined by the mathematical formula below, where x would represent the vector of GRCA abundances across sites and n the number of sites. Hint: If you’re stumped on this one, visit [this web page](http://scbi-migbirds.github.io/writingFunctions) that describes writing functions in R.

$$StdErr (x) = \frac{StDev(x)}{\sqrt{n}}$$
